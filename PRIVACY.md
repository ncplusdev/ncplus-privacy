PRIVACY POLICY FOR NC Hub Manager

Last Updated: 18 Dec 2025

1. Overview
NC Hub Manager ("we," "our," or "the App") is a professional mobile client for accessing the Netcraft Plus computer club management cloud platform ("the Platform"). The App is intended exclusively for authorised club owners who are current clients of the Netcraft Plus Platform.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when using this client App. By accessing or using the App, you confirm that you have read and understood this Policy. If you do not agree to it, please discontinue using the App.

2. Information We Collect
We follow the principle of data minimisation, collecting only the information strictly necessary for the secure operation as a client to the Platform.

2.1 Information You Provide

Telephone Number: Your mobile phone number is requested solely to verify access rights. The App checks your number against a secure pre-authorized list ("allowlist") maintained on the Netcraft Plus Platform's remote server, which contains data of its current clients.

2.2 Information Collected Automatically

Firebase Installation ID (FID): A random, app-specific identifier generated by Google Firebase. It is used exclusively to securely associate your authenticated session with your specific device and to enable re-authentication without requesting an SMS.

Usage and Log Data: We record technical data such as login/logout timestamps and system error logs (via Firebase Crashlytics). This data is used to maintain security, detect unauthorised access attempts, and improve app stability.

Cached Session Data: To improve performance, the App may temporarily store the following technical metadata of your active session in a secure cloud storage (Firestore): a list of club identifiers you have access to, and timestamps of recent actions. All business data (computer status, financial reports) is loaded in real-time directly from the Netcraft Plus Platform servers and is not retained in this storage.

3. How We Use Your Information
Your information is used exclusively for the following purposes:

Authentication & Authorisation: To verify that you are a current client of the Netcraft Plus Platform and to determine your access rights to specific clubs.

Device-Session Binding: To enable secure login and prevent unauthorised access from other devices.

Platform Interface Delivery: To correctly display business data in the App, requested in real-time from the Platform.

Security & Stability: To monitor for suspicious activity, protect data, and improve App performance.

We do not use your information for advertising, marketing, profiling, or tracking across other apps and websites.

4. Data Storage, Retention & Security
4.1 Lifecycle of Session Data
Your session data in the cloud storage (Firestore) is created, used, and deleted according to the following principle:

Record Creation: Upon first successful login to the App using an SMS code, a unique record (document) is created in Firestore containing your phone number (phone_number), Firebase Installation ID (installation_id), and other session metadata.

Use for Re-authentication: This record allows for secure re-login without requesting an SMS while the session is active.

Deletion on Logout: When you press the "Log Out" button, the corresponding record (phone number and installation ID) in Firestore is immediately and permanently deleted.

New Cycle: Upon your next login to the App (with re-entering the phone number and receiving an SMS), a new record is created in Firestore with updated metadata. Thus, no history of your sessions accumulates in the cloud; only the current active session is stored.

Result: Session data exists in Firestore only for the period between a successful SMS login and pressing the "Log Out" button. Deletion upon logout is complete.

4.2 Security Measures
We implement robust technical controls:

End-to-End Encryption: All data transmitted between the App, our session storage (Firestore), and the Netcraft Plus Platform servers is protected by industry-standard HTTPS/TLS encryption.

Platform-Side Validation: Every App request for business data is validated by the Netcraft Plus servers against your access rights.

5. Third-Party Services
We use the following providers to ensure App functionality:

Google Firebase: For identity authentication (SMS), secure cloud storage of session metadata (Firestore), and crash diagnostics (Crashlytics). Firebase acts as a data processor on our behalf.

Netcraft Plus Platform: Is the provider of the core business service and the ultimate source of all displayed business data.

Telecommunications Providers: To deliver SMS verification codes.

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing or analytics.

6. Your Rights & Choices

Right to Delete Session Data: You can trigger the immediate deletion of all your current session data stored by this App at any time by simply pressing the "Log Out" button.

Data Access: You can view the phone number used for access and the list of authorised clubs within the App interface.

Client Account & Business Data Management: This mobile application is only a client for accessing the Netcraft Plus Platform. All matters related to the management of your client account on the Platform, your subscription, and the complete deletion of your business data are handled exclusively under your agreement with the Netcraft Plus Platform. For such requests, as well as for inquiries regarding the deletion of technical App logs, please contact us at the email provided in Section 8.

7. International Data Transfers
Your information may be processed on servers located outside your home country (including the United States) by our infrastructure providers (Google). We ensure these transfers comply with applicable data protection laws through Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).
