PRIVACY POLICY FOR NC Hub Manager

Last Updated: 18 Dec 2025

1. Overview
NC Hub Manager ("we," "our," or "the App") is a professional business-grade mobile application designed to provide authorised computer-club owners with secure, remote access to operational and financial data for their clubs ("the Service").

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use the App. By accessing or using the Service, you confirm that you have read and understood this Policy. If you do not agree to it, please discontinue using the App.

2. Information We Collect
We follow the principle of data minimisation, collecting only the information strictly necessary for the secure operation of the Service.

2.1 Information You Provide

Telephone Number: Your mobile phone number is collected solely to verify your identity.

Authorization Process: Before authentication, the App verifies your number against a secure, pre-authorized list maintained on our remote server.

SMS Verification: If your number is found on the authorized list, a one-time password (OTP) is sent via SMS to complete the login process. If the number is not authorized, no further data is processed.

SMS Verification Code: Used exclusively for identity verification during the login session.

2.2 Information Collected Automatically

Firebase Installation ID (FID): A random, app-specific identifier generated by Google Firebase. It is used to:

Securely associate your authenticated session with your specific device.

Maintain a trusted connection and prevent unauthorised access from other devices.

Usage and Log Data: We record technical data such as login/logout timestamps and system error logs (via Firebase Crashlytics). This data is used to maintain security, detect unauthorised access attempts, and improve app stability.

Authorisation Data: The system stores unique club identifiers and specific access permissions linked to your verified phone number to retrieve the correct club data.

3. How We Use Your Information
Your information is used exclusively for legitimate business-operational purposes:

User Authentication: To verify that you are an authorised club owner.

Access Control: To ensure you only see data for the clubs you are permitted to manage.

Service Delivery: To retrieve real-time financial and operational metrics.

Security & Fraud Prevention: To monitor for suspicious activity and protect the integrity of your club's data.

We do not use your information for advertising, marketing, profiling, or tracking across other apps and websites.

4. Data Storage, Retention & Security
4.1 Automatic Data Deletion (The "Log Out" Rule) We strictly adhere to a policy of not storing personal identifiers longer than necessary.

Your Telephone Number and Firebase Installation ID are stored in our cloud database (Google Firestore) only while your session is active.

Once you click the "Log Out" button and confirm the action, these identifiers are immediately and permanently deleted from our cloud servers.

4.2 Storage Locations

On Your Device: A secure local cache (SharedPreferences) stores temporary session tokens and club lists for performance. This data is cleared upon logout or uninstallation.

Cloud Infrastructure: We use Google Firebase (Firestore), which complies with high-level international security standards (ISO 27001, SOC 1/2/3).

4.3 Security Measures We implement robust technical controls:

Transport Encryption: All data transferred between the App and our servers is protected by industry-standard HTTPS/TLS encryption.

Server-Side Verification: All access requests are validated against our authorised list before any club data is released.

5. Third-Party Services
We use the following providers to ensure App functionality:

Google Firebase: For identity authentication (SMS), secure cloud storage (Firestore), and crash diagnostics (Crashlytics). Firebase acts as a data processor on our behalf.

Telecommunications Providers: To deliver SMS verification codes to your mobile device.

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing or analytics.

6. Your Rights & Choices
Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten): You can trigger the immediate deletion of your identifiers from our servers at any time by simply logging out of the App.

Data Access: You can view your registered number and authorised clubs within the App interface.

Account Deletion: For requests to remove any remaining technical logs, contact us at the email provided in Section 8.

7. International Data Transfers
Your information may be processed on servers located outside your home country (including the United States) by our infrastructure provider (Google). We ensure these transfers comply with applicable data protection laws through Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

8. Contact Information

9. Children’s Privacy
NC Hub Manager is a B2B (Business-to-Business) tool intended exclusively for adult users (18+). We do not knowingly collect data from children.

10. Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect technical or legal changes. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this document indicates the latest version.
